        <p>Hi! This is Salwa. Thank you for being my best friend so far. You are the person who knows me best, you are always the first to know about what I am facing or what I am planning. You are the person who knows my strengths and weaknesses. You accompanied my quite complicated teenage years. Forgive me for my past mistakes. I deeply regret all my carelessness that broke your trust or some incidents that hurt you. I am very happy that we met as good friends. You know what I really need when I am happy and sad. I love you more than you know.</p>
        <p>I want you to fill in some questions below! Please fill them in honestly.</p>
